 * PayrollCalculator class computes salary components, including deductions and allowances.

 * - Single Responsibility Principle: Focused solely on salary computation
 * - High Cohesion: All methods are related to payroll calculations
 * - Dependency Injection: Uses Employee objects passed as parameters
 * - Abstraction: Hides complex calculation details behind simple method interfaces
 * - Polymorphism: Uses polymorphic deduction calculations
